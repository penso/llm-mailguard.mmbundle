# Agent Instructions

## Git Commit Messages

Follow the conventions from https://cbea.ms/git-commit/

### The Seven Rules

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*

### Subject Line Test

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to
complete the following sentence:

- If applied, this commit will *your subject line here*

### Example

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely).

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

 - Bullet points are okay, too
 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet
